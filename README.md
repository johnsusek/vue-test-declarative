# Introduction

Writing Vue components is a pleasure, but when it comes time to test them, suddenly the fun goes away. What if there was an easier way to get started testing your components? A way to describe your tests in a familiar declarative format, without having to learn the entire JS testing ecosystem just to be a responsible developer? Well **vue-test-declarative** aims to do just that, letting you spend more time thinking about what to test and less time thinking about the details of running the tests.

Its aim is to sit alongside vue-test-utils and provide an easy to approach entry point into unit testing. The vue-test-utils package will always be available to you for custom behavior or scenarios not covered by vue-test-declarative. In this way vue-test-declarative aims to be additive to the ecosystem, instead of replacing anything.

# Installation

* Create a new vue-cli project with mocha unit testing
  * For existing projects use `vue add @vue/unit-mocha`
  * For older projects, non vue-cli projects, and other scenarios, [see here](https://github.com/johnsusek/vue-test-declarative/blob/master/docs/Install.md)
* Run `npm install --save-dev vue-test-declarative expect jsdom jsdom-global`
* Add `"test:declarative": "vue-test-declarative"` to the `scripts` section of package.json

# Usage


## Write test
For this example we'll test the `HelloWorld` component from the default vue-cli template. 

Create a `HelloWorld.vuetest` file anywhere in your project with these contents:

```xml
<tests for="@/components/HelloWorld.vue">
  <it will="render message correctly" v-bind:props="props">
    <expect text to-match="Welcome!" />
  </it>
</tests>

<script>
let context = {
  props: {
    msg: 'Welcome!',
  }
};
</script>
```

## Run tests

`npm run test:declarative`

This command will generate and run mocha tests for all .vuetest files in your project.

## vuetest.setup.js

Sometimes your tests will require you to import and register components you are using (like vuetify or element-ui). If you need this functionality, create a `vuetest.setup.js` file in the project root that defines a variable called `localVue`. This will be used instead of the default Vue instance when running your tests.

```javascript
import ElementUI from 'element-ui';
import { createLocalVue } from '@vue/test-utils';

let localVue = createLocalVue();
localVue.use(ElementUI);
```
